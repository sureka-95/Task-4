# Given list
numbers = [10, 501, 22, 37, 100, 99, 87, 351]

# Creating empty lists
even_numbers = []
odd_numbers = []

# Using a for loop to separate numbers
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:#i check if it is divisible by 2 
        even_numbers.append(num)# then add 
    else:
        odd_numbers.append(num)# not divisble by 2

# Printing the results
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
